# Hello, World (again)

Well, here's a first attempt in around 20 years of having a website. Given the state of social media and
the inability to own one's own content on popular platforms, I decided to put up a website where I can post photos, videos, and
general updates while retaining full ownership of the content without Facebook, Twitter, or other sites terms of service coming
into play.
